        <h2>Design and Passive Ventilation Optimization</h2>

        <p>
          My interest in passive cooling began in a middle school Social Studies classroom in Saudi Arabia, where I first encountered the iconic
          <strong>Barjeel</strong> of the Gulf coast. This curiosity was later reinforced through Pakistan Studies and classroom discussions on the
          <strong>Manghu</strong>—wind-scoops found across the Sindh and Balochistan regions. I became aware that from the deserts of the Hejaz to the
          coast of Makran, diverse cultures independently developed sophisticated architectural strategies for moving air without electricity.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am now revisiting this shared architectural heritage through the lens of modern fluid dynamics. In this project, I examine how contemporary
          flow-control principles—drawn from aerospace and automotive engineering—can be used to better understand, reinterpret, and extend the underlying
          physical logic of the Manghu and Barjeel within a theoretical design framework focused on sustainable passive ventilation.

        <p>
          This project investigates the design of a passive windcatcher system using first-principles fluid mechanics to improve airflow delivery without
          mechanical assistance. Working independently and without access to experimental or computational facilities, I developed a theoretically grounded
          design incorporating bell-mouth inlets, controlled geometric transitions, and flow-guiding vanes inspired by diffuser and inlet theory. The project
          emphasizes design reasoning, cross-disciplinary synthesis, and critical evaluation of assumptions, while explicitly acknowledging the limitations of
          unvalidated theoretical analysis.
